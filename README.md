# This repo contains a NET6 WinForms MyButtonLibrary2.MyButton example:
- Uses Microsoft's Nuget package microsoft.winforms.designer.sdk (1.1.0-prerelease-preview3.22076.5).
- Uses DesignTools "server only" approach  

# A scenario where DesignMode is incorrectly false from the NET6 WinForms designer for a custom control.
Steps to reproduce this bug:
1) In VS2022 make a new NET6 WinForms project
2) Copy \Pack\packages\MyButtonLibrary.1.0.102.nupkg to a local Nuget feed and in your NET6 WinForms project add a Nuget reference to it
3) From the VS2022 tools window drag and drop MyButton control onto Form1
4) **Run-time test (SUCCESS):** Run the app and click the MyButton control. The button text changes. This shows that application settings can be accessed at runtime.
5) Stop the app to return to design mode
6) **Design-time hard coded test (SUCCESS)**: In the Form1 window right-click the MyButton control to access the design-time context menu. Select "Change button text using hard coded text - SUCCESS"
7) **Design-time application settings test (FAIL)**: In the Form1 window right-click the MyButton control to access the design-time context menu. Select "Change button text using application setting - This FAILS"
8) For step 7 you may see the exception "Invalid URI: this hostname could not be parsed".
